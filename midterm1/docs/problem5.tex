\section{5}

Give an example of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) which simultaneously satisfies the following two conditions (with proper justification):

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item starting from any initial value, the mean of the SDE will eventually converge to zero, and
	\item the variance of the SDE is unbounded as $t$ tends to infinity.
\end{enumerate}
