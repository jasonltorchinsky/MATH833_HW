\section{3}

Determine the veracity of each of the following statements, and justify your claims.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The varinace of a conditional distribution $\func{p}{x\ \vert\ y}$ should be no greater than the variance of the associated marignal distribution $\func{p}{x}$.
	
	\item The kurtosis of the following stochastic differential equation can exceed three
	
		\begin{equation}
			dx = \gpr{F + a\,x + b\,x^2 - c\,x^3}\,dt + \sigma\,d{W_{A}}
		\end{equation}
		
		where each parameter is constant.
		
	\item In numerical schemes for solving stochastic differential equations, the order of strong convergence should always be less than that of weak convergence.	
\end{enumerate}
