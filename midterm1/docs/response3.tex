\textit{Response.}

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Not sure, probably involves the definition
		\begin{equation}
			\int_{y \in Y} \func{p}{x\ \vert\ y'}\,dy' = \func{p}{x}
		\end{equation}
		
		I'd guess true?
		
	\item I think so, depending on the kurtosis of a normal distribution, since this is a non-linear SDE.
	
	\item Can be less than or equal, since strong covergence is a stronger property than weak convergence.
\end{enumerate}
