\section{6}

Consider the following stochastic differential equation

\begin{equation}
	dx = \gpr{F + a\,x + b\,x^2 - c\,x^3}\,dt + \gpr{A - B\,x}\,dW + \sigma\,d{W_{A}},
	\label{eqn:model_6}
\end{equation}

where all parameters are constant.

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Derive the time evolutions of the mean and variance using the quasi-Gaussian closure approximation. Here, the quasi-Gaussian closure approximation assumes all odd-order central moments (excluding the mean) are zero, while all even-order central moments can be repesented by the variance. The relationship of the latter can be established based on the Gaussian distribution.
	
	\item Tune the parameter values such that the equilibrium distribution of Eqn.~\ref{eqn:model_6} is bimodal. Show your parameter values, a realization of the model simulation, and the equilibrium distribution together with the Gaussian fit.
	
	\item Compare the time evolutions of the mean and variance using the method derived from part a) and using a Monte Carlo simulation. The initial values come from a Gaussian distribution $\func{\mathcal{N}}{10,\ 9}$ with mean 10 and variance 9.
