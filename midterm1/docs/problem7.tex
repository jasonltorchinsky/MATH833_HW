\section{7}

Assume we have many tracers in a doubly-periodic two-dimensional square domain, say $\ocinter{0}{2\,\pi} \times \ocinter{0}{2\,\pi}$. These traces are driven by an underlying flow field which also has doubly-periodic boundary conditions. The position of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} is given by

\begin{equation}
	d\va{x}_i = \func{\va{v}}{t,\ \va{x}_i}\,dt + \sigma\,d\func{\va{W}_i}{t},
\end{equation}

where $\va{x}_{i}$, $\va{v}$, and $\va{W}_{i}$ are each two-dimensional real-valued vectors. The underlying flow velocity field $\func{\va{v}}{t,\ \va{x}}$ may be a very complicated function of $\va{x}$, but is incompressible ($\nabla \cdot \va{v} = 0$).

What will the equilibrium distribution of the tracers look like? You can either derive the result, or you can guess a distribution and then plug in the related equation to validate your result. Include a brief explanation of why your answer makes sense intuitively.
