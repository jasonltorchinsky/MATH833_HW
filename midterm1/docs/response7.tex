\textit{Response.}

We begin by noting that an equilibrium distribution may not exist for a given flow field. For example, consider the flow field $\func{\va{v}}{t,\ x} = \mqty[1 & 0]$ and the initial distribution of all particles on the $y$-axis. The mean of the distribution is given by

\begin{equation}
	d\gang{\va{x}_i } = \gang{\mqty[1 & 0]}\,dt \impl \gang{\va{x}_i} = \mqty[\func{\text{mod}}{t,\ 2\,\pi} & 0]
\end{equation}

In the limit as $t \to \infty$, this distribution does not converge.

More generally, 

considering the case of no stochastic forcing, i.e., $\sigma = 0$. In this case, each particle moves along the streamline on which it initially lies. Thus, from the double-periodicity of the domain and underlying flow field,
