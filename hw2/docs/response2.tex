\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item \textbf{How do you prove these equations? they seem to follow immediately from definitions.}
	
	To derive the equations for switching times and expected values, we recall the construction of a Markov jump process: Let $\gbrc{X_t\ :\ 0 \leq t < \infty}$ be the temporal evolution of the Markov jump process we will construct, in a state space $\mathcal{S}$. We denote the sequence of states visited by $Z_0,\ Z_1,\ \dots,\ Z_{n}$ where $Z_{n+1} \neq Z_{n}$, so that the sequence only contains jumps between different states. Further, the times these jumps are made are denoted by $0 = J_0 < J_1 < \dots$. The full evolution of $X_t$ is thus defined by $X_t = Z_n$ for $t \in \cointer{J_n}{J_{n+1}}$.
	
	From the required property of time-homogeneity of the Markov jump process, we know that $J_n$ may depend on the current state but cannot depend on the amount of time
