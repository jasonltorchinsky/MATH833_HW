Let $\gpr{\va{x},\ \va{y}}$ be the state variables of a non-linear system, where $\va{x}$ and $\va{y}$ may each be of any size.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Write down a system that satisfies conditional Gaussinity for both $\func{p}{\func{\va{x}}{t}\ \vert\ \func{\va{y}}{s \leq t}}$ and $\func{p}{\func{\va{y}}{t}\ \vert\ \func{\va{x}}{s \leq t}}$.
	
	\item Write down a system that satisfies conditional Gaussinity for both $\func{p}{\func{\va{x}}{t}\ \vert\ \func{\va{y}}{s \leq t}}$ and $\func{p}{\func{\va{y}}{t}\ \vert\ \func{\va{x}}{s \leq t}}$, as well as the conservation of energy in the non-linear terms (i.e., it is physics-constrained). What is the lowest possible dimension of such a system? Why?
\end{enumerate}
