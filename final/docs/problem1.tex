\section{1}

Construct a one-dimensional linear stochastic differential equation such that the equilibrium distribution is the Pareto distribution

\begin{equation}
	\func{p}{x} = \alpha\,x^{-\gpr{\alpha + 1}},\qquad 1 < x < \infty,\quad \alpha > 1.
\end{equation}

Include the necessary derivations.
