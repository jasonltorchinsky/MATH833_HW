\textit{Response.}

The posterior covariance will not always converge to a constant matrix asymptotically using the Kalman filter for linear Gaussian systems, and will only converge under specific conditions. For example, consider the following dynamical and observational models in a standard Kalman filter

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\va{u}_{k+1 \vert k} &= \vb{F}\,\va{u}_{k \vert k} + \va*{\sigma}_{k+1}, \\
		\va{v}_{k+1} &= \vb{G}\,\va{u}_{k+1} + \va*{\sigma}_{k+1}^{o},
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $\va{u}_{k+1}$ is the true signal. If the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$ are non-negative, then the dynamical model not stable and thus the filter is not stable, and the posterior covariance will not necessarily converge to a constant matrix.
