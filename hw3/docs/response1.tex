\textit{Response.} 

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item We begin by writing the model in matrix form
	
	\begin{equation}
		\dv{\va{u}}{t} = \vb{F}\,\va{u} + \vb{\Sigma}\,\dot{\va{W}},
	\end{equation}
	
	where
	
	\begin{equation}
		\va{u} = \mqty[u_1 \\ u_2],\qquad \vb{F} = \mqty[F_{11} & F_{12} \\ F_{21} & F_{22}],\qquad \vb{\Sigma} = \mqty[\sigma_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_2],\qquad \dot{\va{W}} = \mqty[\dot{W}_1 \\ \dot{W}_{2}].
	\end{equation}
	
	Since the model is linear with Gaussian noise, we know that the equilibrium distribution is a unique Gaussian. Hence, the equilibrium distribution is given by solving the equations

	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			\dv{\gang{\va{u}}_{eq}}{t} = 0,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\dv{\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq}}{t} = 0.
		\end{equation}	
	\end{subequations}
	
	To examine the first of these equations, we note that we may write the solution to the differential equation for $\gang{\va{u}}$ explicitly
	
	\begin{equation}
		\dv{\gang{\va{u}}}{t} = \vb{F}\,\gang{\va{u}} \qquad \impl \qquad \gang{\va{u}} = \vb{Q}\,\mqty[e^{\lambda_1\,t} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{\lambda_2\,t}]\,\vb{Q}^{-1}\,\gang{\va{u}}_0,
	\end{equation}
	
	where $\vb{Q}$ is the eigenvector matrix of $\vb{F}$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$, and $\gang{\va{u}}_0$ is the initial mean of $\va{u}$. Notice that we assumed $\vb{F}$ to be diagonalizable (to utilize the eigenvalue decomposition) and that the mean is finite for large $t$ if and only if the real part of the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$ are non-positive. If the real part of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are zero and their imaginary part is non-zero, then $\gang{u_1}$ and $\gang{u_2}$ will forever oscillate and there will be no equilibrium mean. On the other hand, if the real part of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are negative then $\gang{u_1}$ and $\gang{u_2}$ will always decay toward zero and thus the equilibrium mean will exist, i.e., either the real part of the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$ must be negative or the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$ must be zero. Since the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$ are given by
	
	\begin{align}
		\lambda_1,\ \lambda_2 &= \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{11} + F_{22}} \pm \sqrt{\gpr{F_{11} - F_{22}}^2 + 4\,F_{12}\,F_{21}}} \nonumber \\
			&= \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{\tr{\vb{F}} \pm \sqrt{\gpr{\tr{\vb{F}}}^2 - 4\,\det{\vb{F}}}}
	\end{align}
	
	this is equivalent to the condition that $\tr{\vb{F}} = F_{11} + F_{22} \leq 0$. Further, we have that $\det{\vb{F}} = \lambda_1\,\lambda_2 \geq 0$ by the non-positivity of the eigenvalues of $\vb{F}$.
	
	Now, to calculate the the equilibrium covariance it is easier to calculate the evolutions of $\vr{u_1}$, $\vr{u_2}$, and $\cov{u_1}{u_2}$ individually. We begin by stating the evolution of $\gang{u_1}$ and $\gang{u_2}$ in scalar form
	
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			d\gang{u_1} = \gpr{F_{11}\,\gang{u_1} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_2}}\,dt,
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			d\gang{u_2} = \gpr{F_{21}\,\gang{u_1} + F_{22}\,\gang{u_2}}\,dt.
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
	
	To calculate the scalar variances and covariance, we note It\^{o}'s formula for a multivariate scalar function
	
	\begin{equation}
		d\func{f}{x,\ y} = \pdv{f}{x}\,dx + \pdv{f}{y}\,dy + \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{\pdv[2]{f}{x}\,\gpr{dx}^2 + 2\,\pdv{f}{x}{y}\,dx\,dy + \pdv[2]{f}{y}\,\gpr{dy}^2}.
	\end{equation}
	
	Specifically, for $\func{f}{u_1,\ u_2}$ we have
	
	\begin{align}
		d\func{f}{u_1,\ u_2} &= \pdv{f}{u_1}\,du_1 + \pdv{f}{u_2}\,du_2 + \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{\pdv[2]{f}{u_1}\,\gpr{du_1}^2 + 2\,\pdv{f}{u_1}{u_2}\,du_1\,du_2 + \pdv[2]{f}{u_2}\,\gpr{du_2}^2} \nonumber \\
			&= \pdv{f}{u_1}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1} + \pdv{f}{u_2}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{21}\,u_1 + F_{22}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2} \nonumber \\
				&\qquad + \frac{1}{2}\,\left( \pdv[2]{f}{u_1}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1}^2 \right. \nonumber \\
				&\qquad\qquad \phantom{+ \frac{1}{2}} + \left. 2\,\pdv{f}{u_1}{u_2}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_1\,dW_1} \right. \nonumber \\
				&\qquad\qquad\qquad \phantom{+ \frac{1}{2}} \cdot \left. \gpr{\gpr{F_{21}\,u_1 + F_{22}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2} \right. \nonumber \\
				&\qquad\qquad \phantom{+ \frac{1}{2}} + \left. \pdv[2]{f}{u_2}\,\gpr{\gpr{F_{21}\,u_1 + F_{22}\,u_2}\,dt + \sigma_2\,dW_2}^2 \right) \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{\pdv{f}{u_1}\,\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2} + \pdv{f}{u_2}\,\gpr{F_{21}\,u_1 + F_{22}\,u_2} + \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{\sigma_1^2\,\pdv[2]{f}{u_1} + \sigma_2^2\,\pdv[2]{f}{u_2}}}\,dt \nonumber \\
			&\qquad + \sigma_1\,\sigma_2\,\pdv{f}{u_1}{u_2}\,dW_1\,dW_2 + \sigma_1\,\pdv{f}{u_1}\,dW_1 + \sigma_2\,\pdv{f}{u_2}\,dW_2
	\end{align}
	
	where we have utilized the fact that $\gpr{dW_1}^2 = \gpr{dW_2}^2 = \func{o}{dt}$, and that $dt^2$, $dt\,dW_1$, and $dt\,dW_2$ go to zero faster than $dt$ in the limit $dt \to 0$.
	
	Now, to calculate the evolution of $\vr{u_1}$ we need only calculate $d\gang{u_1^2}$
	
	\begin{align}
		d\gang{u_1^2} &= \gang{\gpr{2\,u_1\,\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2} + 0 + \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{2\,\sigma_1^2 + 0}}\,dt + 0 + 2\,\sigma_1\,u_1\,dW_1 + 0} \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{2\,\gpr{F_{11}\,\gang{u_1^2} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_1\,u_2}} + \sigma_1^2}\,dt,
	\end{align}
	
	where we have utilized the fact that $u_1$ and $dW_1$ are independent. We may thus obtain
	
	\begin{align}
		d\vr{u_1} &= d\gang{u_1^2} - 2\,\gang{u_1}\,d\gang{u_1} \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{2\,\gpr{F_{11}\,\gang{u_1^2} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_1\,u_2}} + \sigma_1^2}\,dt - 2\,\gpr{F_{11}\,\gang{u_1}^2 + F_{12}\,\gang{u_1}\,\gang{u_2}}\,dt \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{2\,\gpr{F_{11}\,\vr{u_1} + F_{12}\,\cov{u_1}{u_2}} + \sigma_1^2}\,dt.
	\end{align}
	
	We may similarly show that the variance of $u_2$ is governed by a similar equation
	
	\begin{equation}
		d\vr{u_2} = \gpr{2\,\gpr{F_{21}\,\cov{u_1}{u_2} + F_{22}\,\vr{u_2}} + \sigma_2^2}\,dt.
	\end{equation}
	
	Lastly, to obtain the evolution of the covariance of $u_1$ and $u_2$ we first calculate $d\gang{u_1\,u_2}$
	
	\begin{align}
		d\gang{u_1\,u_2} &= \left\langle \gpr{u_2\,\gpr{F_{11}\,u_1 + F_{12}\,u_2} + u_1\,\gpr{F_{21}\,u_1 + F_{22}\,u_2} + \frac{1}{2}\,\gpr{0 + 0}}\,dt \right. \nonumber \\
				&\qquad  + \left.\sigma_1\,\sigma_2\,dW_1\,dW_2 + \sigma_1\,u_2\,dW_1 + \sigma_2\,u_1\,dW_2 \right\rangle \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{\gpr{F_{11} + F_{22}}\,\gang{u_1\,u_2} + F_{21}\,\gang{u_1^2} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_2^2}}\,dt,
	\end{align}
	
	where we have utilized the fact that $dW_1$ and $dW_2$ are independent, $u_2$ and $dW_1$ are independent, and $u_1$ and $dW_2$ are independent. The covariance of $u_1$ and $u_2$ is therefore governed by
	
	\begin{align}
		d\cov{u_1}{u_2} &= d\gang{u_1\,u_2} - \gpr{\gang{u_2}\,d\gang{u_1} + \gang{u_1}\,d\gang{u_2}} \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{\gpr{F_{11} + F_{22}}\,\gang{u_1\,u_2} + F_{21}\,\gang{u_1^2} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_2^2}}\,dt \nonumber \\
				&\qquad - \gpr{\gpr{F_{11}\,\gang{u_1}\,\gang{u_2} + F_{12}\,\gang{u_2}^2}\,dt  + \gpr{F_{21}\,\gang{u_1}^2 + F_{22}\,\gang{u_1}\,\gang{u_2}}\,dt} \nonumber \\
			&= \gpr{\gpr{F_{11} + F_{22}}\,\cov{u_1}{u_2} + F_{21}\,\vr{u_1} + F_{12}\,\vr{u_2}}\,dt.
	\end{align}
	
	We may now actually write the evolution of the covariance of $\va{u}$ in matrix form
	
	\begin{equation}
		\dv{\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}}{t} = \vb{F}\,\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}} + \cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}\,\vb{F}^T + \vb{\Sigma}^2,
	\end{equation}
	
	where we have utilized the symmetry of $\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}$. For this to reach some equilibrium value, we must have
	
	\begin{align}
		\dv{\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq}}{t} = \vb{F}\,\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq} + \cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq}\,\vb{F}^T + \vb{\Sigma}^2 = \vb{0} \nonumber \\
		\qquad \impl \qquad \vb{F}\,\cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq} + \cov{\va{u}}{\va{u}}_{eq}\,\vb{F}^T  = -\vb{\Sigma}^2.
	\end{align}
	
	With great effort, we may solve for $\vr{u_1}_{eq}$, $\vr{u_2}_{eq}$, and $\cov{u_1}{u_2}_{eq}$ explicitly in terms of $\vb{F}$ and $\vb{\Sigma}$ so long as the determinant of $\vb{F}$ is non-zero
	
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{align}
			\vr{u_1}_{eq} &= -\frac{\sigma_1^2\,\gpr{\det{\vb{F}} + F_{22}^2} + \sigma_2^2\,F_{12}^2}{2\,\tr{\vb{F}}\,\det{\vb{F}}}, \\
			\vr{u_2}_{eq} &= -\frac{\sigma_1^2\,F_{21}^2 + \sigma_2^2\,\gpr{\det{\vb{F}} + F_{11}^2}}{2\,\tr{\vb{F}}\,\det{\vb{F}}}, \\
			\cov{u_1}{u_2}_{eq} &= \frac{\sigma_1^2\,F_{21}\,F_{22} + \sigma_2^2\,F_{11}\,F_{12}}{2\,\tr{\vb{F}}\,\det{\vb{F}}}.
		\end{align}
	\end{subequations}	
	
	As $\vr{u_1}$ and $\vr{u_2}$ must be positive, we also have that the trace of $\vb{F}$ must be negative. \textbf{In summary}, for the equilibrium distribution to exist, we must have $\tr{\vb{F}} = F_{11} + F_{22} < 0$ and $\det{\vb{F}} = F_{11}\,F_{22} - F_{12}\,F_{21} > 0$. Note that this also implies that $\gang{\va{u}}_{eq} = \va{0}$.
	
	\item Below we include a plot of the equilibrium probability density function (Figure~\ref{fig:1b_eq_pdf}), a single trajectory for 100 time-units (Figure~\ref{fig:1b_traj}), and the ensemble statistics calculated from 500 trajectories (Figure~\ref{fig:1b_ens_stats}). Each realization utilized a time-step size of $\Delta t = 0.1$.

	and is given in Appendix~\ref{app:code_1b}. In short, the code takes a input parameters \texttt{-{-}F\_11}, \texttt{-{-}F\_12}, \texttt{-{-}F\_21}, \texttt{-{-}F\_12}, \texttt{-{-}sigma\_1}, and \texttt{-{-}sigma\_2} which correspond to $F_{11}$, $F_{12}$, $F_{21}$, $F_{22}$, $\sigma_1$, and $\sigma_2$, respectively. The code then calculates the equilibrium distribution from the analytic formulas derived in part a), simulates 500 indivual realizations of Eqs.~\ref{eqs:model_1} using the Euler--Maruyama method, and plots a single trajectory along with the statistics across all 500 realizations.
	
	\item We begin by rewriting the system model in a discretized form as a matrix equation
	
	\begin{equation}
		\va{u}_{k+1} = \gpr{\vb{\mathcal{I}} + h\,\vb{F}}\,\va{u}_{k} + \sqrt{h}\,\vb{\Sigma}\,\va*{\xi}_{k+1}
	\end{equation}		
	
	where $k$ indexes the time-step, $\vb{\mathcal{I}}$ is the identity matrix, $h$ is the time-step size (e.g., $h = 0.1$ in the realizations in part b)) and $\va*{\xi}_{k+1}$ is a vector of independent zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian noise.	We also write the observation model in discretized form as a matrix equation

	\begin{equation}
		\va{v}_{k+1} = \vb{G}\,\va{u} + \vb{\Sigma}^{o}\,\va*{\zeta}_{k+1}
	\end{equation}
		
	where 
	
	\begin{equation}
		\va{v} = \mqty[v_1 \\ v_2],\qquad \vb{G} = \mqty[g_1 & 0 \\ 0 & g_2],\qquad \vb{\Sigma}^{o} = \mqty[\sigma_1^{o} & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_2^{o}],
	\end{equation}
	
	and $\va*{\zeta}_{k+1}$ is a vector of independent zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian noise.
	
	The prior mean $\overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k}$ and prior covariance $\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k}$ of the Kalman filter is given by
	
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			\overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k} = \gpr{\vb{\mathcal{I}} + h\,\vb{F}}\,\overline{\va{u}}_{k \vert k},
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k} = \gpr{\vb{\mathcal{I}} + h\,\vb{F}}\,\vb{\Sigma}_{k \vert k}\,\gpr{\vb{\mathcal{I}} + h\,\vb{F}}^T + \vb{\Sigma},
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
	
	and the posterior mean $\overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k+1}$ and posterior covariance $\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k+1}$ of the Kalman filter is given by
	
	\begin{subequations}
		\begin{equation}
			\overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k+1} = \overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k} + \vb{K}_{k+1}\,\gpr{\va{v}_{k+1} - \vb{G}\,\overline{\va{u}}_{k+1 \vert k}},
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k+1} = \gpr{\vb{\mathcal{I}} - \vb{K}_{k+1}\,\vb{G}}\,\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k},
		\end{equation}
	\end{subequations}
	
	where $\vb{K}_{k+1}$ is the Kalman gain matrix
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vb{K}_{k+1} = \vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k}\,\vb{G}^T\,\gpr{\vb{G}\,\vb{\Sigma}_{k+1 \vert k}\,\vb{G}^T + \vb{\Sigma}^{o}}^{-1}.
	\end{equation}
	
	Below we include a plot of the prior and posterior statistics (Figure~\ref{fig:1c_stats}) and cross correlation between the truth signal and prior and posterior mean (Figure~\ref{fig:1c_corr}). Both the simulation time-step size and observation time-step size used were $\Delta t = 0.25$. We found that the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_1}$ was $0.1151$ for prior and $0.0199$ for posterior, and the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_2}$ was $0.3927$ for prior and $0.3720$ for posterior.

	and is given in Appendix~\ref{app:code_1c}. In short, the code takes a input parameters \texttt{-{-}F\_11}, \texttt{-{-}F\_12}, \texttt{-{-}F\_21}, \texttt{-{-}F\_12}, \texttt{-{-}sigma\_1}, \texttt{-{-}sigma\_2}, \texttt{-{-}g\_1}, \texttt{-{-}g\_{2}}, \texttt{-{-}sigma\_1o}, and \texttt{-{-}sigma\_2o} which correspond to $F_{11}$, $F_{12}$, $F_{21}$, $F_{22}$, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $g_1$, $g_2$, $\sigma_1^{o}$, and $\sigma_2^{o}$ respectively. The code is very similar to that of part b), with the addition of storing the prior and posterior statistics, as well as the truth signal. It is a relatively straightforward implementation of the aforementioned algorithm, and also calculates the root-mean-square error and cross-correlation between the prior and posterior means and the truth signal.
	
	\item Using the code from part c) with minor modifications (specifically to output file names), we generated a plot of the prior and posterior statistics (Figure~\ref{fig:1d_stats}) and cross correlation between the truth signal and prior and posterior mean (Figure~\ref{fig:1d_corr}). Both the simulation time-step size and observation time-step size used were $\Delta t = 0.25$. We found that the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_1}$ was $0.1070$ for prior and $0.0199$ for posterior, and the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_2}$ was $0.3427$ for prior and $0.3334$ for posterior.
	
	Qualititavely, $g_2 = 0$ means that the Kalman filter always observes $u_2 = 0$, which is the equilbrium mean (plus some noise) for $u_2$. This observation influences the dynamics of $u_1$ through the $F_{12}\,u_2$ term of the $u_1$ dynamics equation.

The variance of $u_2$ and the covariance between $u_1$ and $u_2$ is slightly larger than that from the case in part c).}

		\label{fig:1d_corr}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item Using the code from parts b) and c) with minor modifications (specifically to output file names), we generated the same plots as in parts b) and c) with the different system parameters (see Figures~\ref{fig:1e_eq_pdf}, \ref{fig:1e_traj}, \ref{fig:1e_ens_stats}, \ref{fig:1e_stats}, and \ref{fig:1e_corr}). We found that the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_1}$ was $0.1006$ for prior and $0.0198$ for posterior, and the root-mean-square error for $\gang{u_2}$ was $0.3429$ for prior and $0.3375$ for posterior.
	
	Similarly to part d), this Kalman filter always observes the euilibrium mean (plus some noise) for $u_2$. However, this observation influences the dynamics of $u_1$ much less than in part d), as the coupling coefficient $F_{12}$ is one-fifth the size.
