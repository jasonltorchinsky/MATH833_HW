\section{2}

Consider the following stochastic differential equation 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		du &= \gpr{-\gamma + i\,\omega}\,u\,dt + \sigma_u\,dW_{u},\\
		d\gamma &= -d_{\gamma}\,\gpr{\gamma - \widehat{\gamma}}\,dt + \sigma_{\gamma}\,dW_{\gamma}.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Choose three sets of parameters, one for each of the following three dynamical regimes:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item a regime of plentiful, short-lasting transient instabilities in the resolved component of $\func{u}{t}$ with a fat-tailed marginal equilibrium probability density function (PDF),

	\item a regime of intermittent large-amplitude bursts of instability in $\func{u}{t}$ with a fat-tailed marginal equilbrium PDF, and
	
	\item a `stable' regime with a nearly Gaussian equilibrium PDF of $\func{u}{t}$.
\end{enumerate}

Provide a general principle of parameter choices to obtain each of these dynamical regimes.
