# MATH833_HW

Code and responses for the homework sets of MATH 833 - Topics in the Theory of Probability, lectured by Prof. Nan Chen of the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the Autumn 2021 semester.

In each subdirectory, there is the soruce code for each problem (in `src`) as well as the write-up for each problem (in `docs`). To run the code, we recommend the geoCAT Anaconda environment, whose installation instructions may be found [here](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
